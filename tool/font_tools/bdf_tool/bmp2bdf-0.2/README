SYNOPSIS
        bmp2bdf [numberOfColumns] input.bdf input.bmp output.bdf

        'numberOfColumns' can be omitted.  If omitted,
        numberOfColumns becomes 32.


DESCRIPTION
        Working with the bdf2bmp utility (not this tool),  the
        bmp2bdf utility (this tool) enables you to modify glyphs
        in a BDF-font-file.

        See EXAMPLES.

EXAMPLES
        1)  Prepare a BDF file.  Now,  'courR14.bdf' is
            prepared.

        2)  Use bdf2bmp to create BMP-image-file.
                $ bdf2bmp courR14.bdf courR14.bmp

        3)  Modify 'courR14.bmp' with some image editor ( like
            Adobe Photoshop, The GIMP,...) .
            For example,  add '0'(zero) with a slant line.
            Save that BMP file in the name 'cr14.bmp'.

        4)  Use bmp2bdf.
                $ bmp2bdf courR14.bdf cr14.bmp cr14.bdf
            You get 'cr14.bdf'.


LIMITATION
        o)  This tool accepts only the BMP files made with
            'bdf2bmp'.

        o)  This tool accepts only that BMP files:
                4/8/24 bits per pixel(16/256/16M colors),
                Windows-format,
                none compression.

        o)  This tool cannot modify DWIDTH,  that is,  the
            distance from this glyph origin to the next glyph
            origin.
            If you want to modify that,  you must modify the
            BDF file directly,  or should use other BDF
            editors.

        This tool internally distinguishes black(R,G,B = 0,0,0)
        from any other colors in the color palette.  This tool
        recognizes white-backgrounds, spacing, and gray colors
        to be equal.


COMPILE
        The author succeeded compiling & executing in
                Linux 2.2.14 and gcc(egcs-2.91.66)

                and

                Windows98 SecondEdition and
                Borland C++ Compiler 5.5.1 for Win32

                on

                IBM-PC compatible, Intel Celeron 433MHz

        This source-code is written in ANSI C style.
        So, you can probably compile and execute in other
        environments.

        An example to compile and install in Linux system:
                $  cc bmp2bdf.c -o bmp2bdf
                $  su
                #  cp bmp2bdf /usr/local/bin
