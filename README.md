2.TempGBA

![Game list](image/tempgba.png)

**Note : 32mb Save working on TempGBA. and gpSP it is still unsupported 32mb save data.**

**Note : Other games are working great.**

## <h3>RAM</h3>

![Game list](image/32mb.gif)

1. Bleach Advance                             : 32.0 MB
2. Kingdom Hearts - Chain of Memories         : 32.0 MB
3. Mother 3                                   : 32.0 MB
4. Riviera - The Promised Land                : 32.0 MB
5. Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Red Rescue Team  : 32.0 MB

Simply, if a large 32MB game in a ZIP-archive then it will be a long time in the TEMP unpacked, you just need to wait a minute, there is a diode will blink rapidly.
If you do not want to wait, and to play immediately loaded, then unzip and run *.gba.
Generally I normally work all of these games.

- UO gpSP Kai 3.4 test 4 build 225 = 16mb Max
- UO gpSP Kai 3.5 Mod = 32mb Max
- UO gpSP Kai 3.4 test 3 build 152 = 32mb Max


32mb Max ROM Buff achieved when Unlock Extra Memory is enabled from Recovery Menu... If I disable Unlock Extra Memory, it is 16mb again but other gpSP emulators are still 32mb Max ROM Buff.
32mb ROM / 32mb buff = Faster loading, less glitchy
32mb ROM / 16mb Buff = Very slow loading, PSP freeze sometimes, unpacks and duplicates *.zip ROM to *.gba so uses more space. At least it does on a few other gpSP emulators.

## Creating & Adding Cheats

[Uo gpSP kai Cheats](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/emulator-cheats/releases/tag/0.2)

<u><b>::Requirements::</b></u>

- Action Replay or Gameshark Codes for a certain game
- gpSP Kai Cheat Creator.exe [Downlaod](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/emulator-cheats/releases/tag/0.2)
- Hacked PSP with the most recent gpSP Kai

1) All gpSP Kai cheat codes should be inserted in ms0:/PSP/Game/gpSP Kai/GBA/CHT , assuming that gpSP Kai is any version of the Gameboy Advance Emulator. These cheat codes have a specific format, which is .cht .

2) Gather the Action Reply/Gameshark codes that you want and open up the gpSP Kai Cheat Creator.exe program. Enter the game name at the top bar in the program (i.e. Pokemon Emerald). The game name will help you identify the cheat file.

3) There is a specific form in which you need to enter these codes to get a .cht file.

<u>Action Replay Form :</u>

PAR_V3 (name of code) <---make sure PAR_V3 and the code name is separated by a space
XXXXXXXX YYYYYYYY
XXXXXXXX YYYYYYYY

Enter the code as shown in the X and Y column above if it is an Action Reply Code. Remember that there are 8 characters in each column because it is an Action Replay Code. Column X is separated from Column Y with a space. If the code has more than two lines, do not get part of it and instead get the whole thing.

<u>Gameshark Form :</u>

gameshark_V3 (name of code) <-----again, gameshark_V3 is separated from the code name
XXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXX

Enter the code as shown in the X rows. In gameshark form, there are not columns, but there are rows. Remember that there are 12 characters in each row because it is in gameshark form. After one row ends, another row starts. If the code has more than two lines, do not get part of it and instead get the whole thing.

4) Enter the codes that you have gathered in the wide box area of the gpSP Kai cheat creator program after you put them in the gameshark/Action Replay form from above. After every code, make sure to not leave them attached to eachother, for this will mess up the code. Press the "enter" key to separate them.

5) Create the .cht file after you enter all the codes.

6) Connect your PSP to your computer using a USB Cord. Go to this directory: ms0:/PSP/GAME/gpSP Kai/GBA/CHT . This directory may not be the same as others, and if that is the case, then just look for the CHT folder in your gpSP Kai.

7) Insert your new .cht file into the CHT Folder

8) Disconnect your PSP from the USB Cord and start up your gpSP Kai. After you start the game that you made the .cht file for, press the triangle button to open up the gpSP Kai menu. In that menu, you should see the words "Cheats and Miscellaneous Options". Click on those words to take you to the cheats part of the menu.

9) Go to "Load Cheat File". Then, you will see the .cht file that you recently created. Click on that cheat file.

10) Loading the certain .cht file will show you the cheats that are in that .cht file. You can disable/enable those cheats in the menu.

## Comparison

<b><i>TempGBA-mod vs Uo gpSP kai</b></i>

TempGBA-mod, I was wondering which emulator is better, im saying this because the video quality in tempGBA's "150% SW" mode, make the video output look much cleaner, dunno what exactly is the difference between it and "GU" (which looks a lot like the video output gpSP has) but just looks better.
i also noticed that pokemon fire red and ultra violet dont tell me that the 1m chip isnt there, does tempGBA support 1m saves while gpSP doesn't?
nvm, figured out that tempGBA has a rudimentary version of this, each game has its own control profile
why is it that neither emulator saves the CPU frenquency i set it to? <--- figured out how to make tempGBA do it, gpSP seemingly cant do it.
UO gpSP Kai to be the fastest. It does support 1M saves too. Here's the latest version: [Uo gpSP kai mod 3.5](http://www.mediafire.com/file/daukxkdjmpjat94/uo_gpsp_kai_latest.tar.lzma/file)
i said regarding 1m saves is that for some reason they gave me an error in gpSP but not on tempGBA, so if the support is there, why doesnt it work?
TempGBA is supposed to have better compatibility / less glitches for some games than gpSP (e.g. Golden Sun). The speed, as far I could see back when I used gpSP is about the same.

As for the "GU" output, that's supposed to be accelerated video (=faster), whereas SW is software, which should probably be slower, although theoretically more accurate (less glitches). I use GU all the time though, and have yet to find a game that has any problem with it.

## Change log

-<b>Unofficial gpSP Kai 3.4 Test 4 Build 230</b>
        Fixed regression: Analog Nub mapping works separately from Dpad again.
        Fixed regression: Now by default, GBA button 'B' is mapped to 'Cross' and GBA button 'A' is
        mapped to 'Circle' to match a real GBA. The 225 build had these buttons reversed by default.
       'Update backup' is now defaulted to 'Automatic' rather than 'Exit only'. It can still be
        configured on a per game basis.

<b>Update</b>
Use this new '230' build, not the '228' build I originally uploaded (there was a bug in keymapping). Also, if you used the 'cfg' folder from the '228' archive, replace it with the one in this '230' archive or the '225' archive (they're both the same).
Also, in addition to the 'Slim' build, the 'Fat' build is now tested as well and reported to be working fine.

-<b>Unofficial gpSP kai 3.4 Test 4 Build 225</b>
Fixed lots of bugs, mostly inconsistencies in the program code and the code to be translated.
Added new lines in the emulator menu and accordingly in translation language files.
Painted pixel by pixel, and compiled a new font "eureka.fbm".
Also in the font added all German-Spanish-Portuguese-Greek characters umlauts with full Western European encoding cp1252 with the required width for each letter.
Fixed some items are broken before.
Fixed alternating list by changing the buttons in the joystick configuration.
Now run almost all games from ZIP archives. Previously, large files are not unpacked emulator.

<b>Other minor fixes.</b>

Signed to run on the official firmware, and of course on the custom firmware.
For emulator is available about 3000 games *.gba or *.bin format. [note: sentence removed by mods]
To save space on the memory card, compress images * .gba in ZIP-format archives.
Images should be expanded in the folder: "UO gрSP kai \ GBA \ ROM".
